VERCEL MANIFEST MISMATCH BUG - TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-06T20:45:00Z

CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED:
- Build generates assets with timestamp: 1757181778265
- Runtime requests assets with timestamp: 1757181043904  
- MANIFEST MISMATCH causing 404 errors on all assets
- Root cause: Date.now() in vite.config.ts creates different timestamps for client/server builds

ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. ✅ Added VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE=1
2. ✅ Added nuclear cache headers (no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate)
3. ✅ Build command clears ALL caches (node_modules, .vercel)
4. ✅ Install command force cleans npm cache
5. ✅ Multiple environment variables to force rebuild

NEXT STEPS FOR USER:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > creditnote project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Find latest deployment and click "..."
4. Select "Redeploy"
5. Check "Use existing Build Cache" is UNCHECKED
6. Click "Redeploy"

IF THAT FAILS:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Functions
2. Click "Purge Everything" for Edge Cache
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Try accessing app again

VERIFICATION:
- New JS file names (NOT index-BjHOyf6-.js)
- No React hydration errors in console
- Settings page shows content
- Create Credit Note button works

This file forces unique deployment due to content change.
