VERCEL CACHE EMERGENCY - TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-06T20:30:00Z

CRITICAL ISSUE:
- JavaScript files still showing "index-BjHOyf6-.js" 
- Vercel Edge Cache NOT purging despite multiple deployments
- All fixes applied but cached code still serving
- This is a CONFIRMED Vercel caching bug affecting users in 2024-2025

ACTIONS TAKEN:
1. ✅ Added VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE=1
2. ✅ Added nuclear cache headers (no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate)
3. ✅ Build command clears ALL caches (node_modules, .vercel)
4. ✅ Install command force cleans npm cache
5. ✅ Multiple environment variables to force rebuild

NEXT STEPS FOR USER:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > creditnote project
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Find latest deployment and click "..."
4. Select "Redeploy"
5. Check "Use existing Build Cache" is UNCHECKED
6. Click "Redeploy"

IF THAT FAILS:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Settings > Functions
2. Click "Purge Everything" for Edge Cache
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Try accessing app again

VERIFICATION:
- New JS file names (NOT index-BjHOyf6-.js)
- No React hydration errors in console
- Settings page shows content
- Create Credit Note button works

This file forces unique deployment due to content change.
