# Credit Note App - Issues Fixed

## Summary of All Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Fixed 500 Error on Login Route
**Problem:** The app was trying to access `/login` which didn't exist.
**Solution:** Created a redirect route at `app/routes/login.tsx` that redirects to `/auth/login`.

### 2. ✅ Fixed Database Query Issues
**Problem:** The app was using problematic OR queries with both `shopDomain` and `shop` fields causing failures.
**Files Fixed:** `app/routes/app._index.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Replaced complex OR queries with simple `shopDomain: session.shop` queries
- Added `deletedAt: null` filter for soft deletes
- Removed redundant `shop` field from create operations
- Changed status from "ACTIVE" to "active" to match database schema

### 3. ✅ Fixed Blank Settings Page
**Problem:** The settings page was missing the `List` component import causing a runtime error.
**Solution:** Added `List` to the imports in `app/routes/app.settings.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Fixed React Hydration Errors
**Problems:** React errors #418, #425, #423 were caused by server/client rendering mismatches.
**Solutions:**
- Fixed database queries that were causing inconsistent data
- Ensured proper data serialization in loaders
- Added proper CSP headers for Shopify compliance

### 5. ✅ Added Shopify Compliance
**Added:** Content Security Policy headers in `app/root.tsx`
**Configuration:** Using `addDocumentResponseHeaders` from shopify.server
**Headers:** `frame-ancestors https://*.myshopify.com https://admin.shopify.com;`

## Files Modified

1. **app/routes/app._index.tsx**
   - Fixed database queries (removed OR clauses)
   - Fixed status value from "ACTIVE" to "active"
   - Added proper null handling for deletedAt

2. **app/routes/login.tsx** (NEW)
   - Created redirect route for /login → /auth/login

3. **app/routes/app.settings.tsx**
   - Added missing `List` import from @shopify/polaris

4. **app/root.tsx**
   - Added CSP headers for Shopify compliance
   - Imported `addDocumentResponseHeaders`
   - Added loader function with proper headers

## Configuration
The app is correctly configured with:
- ✅ New embedded auth strategy (`unstable_newEmbeddedAuthStrategy: true`)
- ✅ Proper session storage with Prisma
- ✅ API Version July25
- ✅ App Bridge integration

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Login flow works without 500 error

## Next Steps

- Database queries now match the working creditcraft project pattern
