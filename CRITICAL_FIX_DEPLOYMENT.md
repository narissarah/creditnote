# üö® CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT FIX - Invalid Scopes Issue

## Root Cause Identified
The deployment failure is caused by the `SCOPES` environment variable on Vercel containing invalid scopes that don't exist in Shopify API 2025-07.

### Invalid Scopes Being Used:
- ‚ùå `read_customer_metafields` (doesn't exist)
- ‚ùå `write_customer_metafields` (doesn't exist)
- ‚ùå `read_pos_sessions` (doesn't exist)
- ‚ùå `write_pos_sessions` (doesn't exist)

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Update Vercel Environment Variables

```
read_customers,read_discounts,read_orders,write_customers,write_discounts,write_orders,read_products,write_products,read_inventory,unauthenticated_read_product_listings,unauthenticated_write_checkouts,unauthenticated_read_checkouts,read_locations,write_draft_orders,read_draft_orders
```

### 2. Critical Environment Variables to Verify

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=[your-neon-database-url]
DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED=[your-neon-database-url-unpooled]

# Session Configuration
