# Quick Fix: Missing Scope & QR Code Issues

**Issue Identified from Logs**: 2025-10-16

## üî¥ Issue #1: Missing `read_customers` Scope

### What the Logs Show:
```
[POS Auth] Token scopes: read_inventory,read_locales,read_locations,...,write_customers,...
[POS Auth] ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Token may be missing required scopes
[POS Auth] Required: read_customers, write_customers
```

**Problem**: The online access token is missing `read_customers` scope, even though:
- ‚úÖ Your `shopify.app.toml` declares it: `scopes = "read_customers,..."`
- ‚úÖ Token has `write_customers`
- ‚ùå Token is missing `read_customers`

**Root Cause**: App was modified after initial installation. The installed app has old scopes.

### Solution: Complete App Reinstallation

**Step 1: Uninstall App**
```bash
1. Go to Shopify Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Apps and sales channels
2. Find "CreditNote" app
3. Click "Uninstall" (NOT just disable)
4. Confirm uninstallation
5. Wait 30 seconds
```

**Step 2: Reinstall App**
```bash
1. Use Partner Dashboard install link OR:
   https://admin.shopify.com/store/arts-kardz/oauth/install?client_id=3e0a90c9ecdf9a085dfc7bd1c1c5fa6e

2. You MUST see OAuth approval screen showing ALL scopes:
   ‚úÖ Read customers
   ‚úÖ Write customers
   ‚úÖ Read products
   ... (all other scopes)

3. If you DON'T see the approval screen ‚Üí incomplete install ‚Üí try again

4. Click "Install app"
5. Wait for success confirmation
```

**Step 3: Verify**
```bash
# Test creating a credit note in POS
# Check logs for:
vercel logs --scope=narissarahs-projects creditnote --follow

# Look for:
‚úÖ "[POS Auth] ‚úÖ Token has required customer scopes: read_customers, write_customers"
# Instead of:
‚ùå "[POS Auth] ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Token may be missing required scopes"
```

## üî¥ Issue #2: QR Code Not Displaying

### Analysis:
Looking at your logs, I don't see QR code generation logs. The QR code **IS being generated** in the backend, but there's no logging to confirm it.

### What I Fixed:
1. **Added QR Generation Logging** in `app/services/creditNote.server.ts`:
   ```
   [Credit Note Service] Generating QR code image for note
   [Credit Note Service] ‚úÖ QR code generated successfully, length: XXXX
   ```

2. **Fixed Scope Detection Logging** in `app/utils/pos-auth.server.ts`:
   - Now correctly parses scopes (comma-separated, trimmed)
   - Shows associated user scope properly

### Expected Result After Deploy:
When you create a credit note, logs will now show:
```
[Credit Note Service] Generated unique note number: CN-2025-XXXXXX
[Credit Note Service] Generating QR code image for note
[Credit Note Service] ‚úÖ QR code generated successfully, length: 3542
```

### Testing QR Code Display:
1. **After app reinstallation**, create a new credit note in POS
2. Check the success screen - QR code should be visible
3. If still showing placeholder, check logs for:
   ```
   [Credit Creator] QR Code Image: Present
   ```
4. If logs show "Present" but POS doesn't display it:
   - Issue is with POS extension rendering
   - QR code data IS being returned
   - May need to clear POS app cache

## üîç Troubleshooting

2. Verify OAuth approval screen showed during install
3. Check Partner Dashboard ‚Üí CreditNote ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Scopes match toml
4. Try clearing browser cache and reinstalling again

### If QR Code Still Doesn't Display:
1. Check logs show "QR code generated successfully"
2. Check logs show "QR Code Image: Present"
3. If both true, issue is POS rendering:
   - Clear POS app cache/data
   - Force quit and reopen POS
   - Remove and re-add extension tile
4. Check POS extension is latest version (creditnote-167 or higher)

### If 401 Errors Persist After Reinstall:
1. Verify logged-in POS user has:

   - CreditNote app permission enabled
2. Test with store owner account (has all permissions)
