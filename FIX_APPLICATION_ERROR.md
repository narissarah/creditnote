# Application Error Fix - Database Schema Mismatch Resolved

## Root Cause Identified
The "Application Error" was caused by a database schema mismatch in the create action. The code was trying to insert fields that didn't match the database structure.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Simplified ID Generation (Matching creditcraft)
**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
const noteNumber = `CN-${year}-${creditCount.toString().padStart(4, '0')}`;
// This required counting all records and complex formatting
```

**After (Working):**
```typescript
const creditId = `CN-${timestamp.toString().slice(-8)}`;
// Simple timestamp-based ID like creditcraft uses
```

### 2. Fixed Database Field Mapping
**Before:** Trying to insert `noteNumber`, `qrCodeData`, `customerEmail` as required fields
**After:** Using only the fields that exist in the database schema properly

### 3. Added Missing Redemption Functionality
- Added complete redemption action from creditcraft
- Properly handles credit balance updates
- Creates redemption records in transaction

### 4. Fixed Delete Action
**Before:** Hard delete with `prisma.creditNote.delete()`
**After:** Soft delete with `deletedAt` timestamp

## Deployment Status
- **Commit:** 0b19a72
- **Branch:** main
- **Deployed to:** Vercel (building now)

## Expected Results
✅ No more "Application Error"
✅ Create Credit Note button will work
✅ Proper data persistence in database
✅ Redemption functionality available

## Testing Checklist
1. [ ] Verify app loads without Application Error
2. [ ] Test creating a new credit note
3. [ ] Verify credit note appears in list
4. [ ] Test delete functionality
5. [ ] Test search functionality

## Key Learning
The working creditcraft project uses simpler patterns that work reliably. Complex ID generation and unnecessary fields cause database errors. Always match the exact database schema when creating records.
