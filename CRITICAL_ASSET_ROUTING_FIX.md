# üö® CRITICAL FIX: Asset Routing Issue Resolved

## The Problem
ALL JavaScript and CSS files were returning 404 errors:
```
GET https://creditnote-41ur.vercel.app/assets/entry.client-BkEv3vMM.js 404
GET https://creditnote-41ur.vercel.app/assets/styles-BeiPL2RV.css 404
```

CSS files were returning HTML with wrong MIME type:
```
Refused to apply style from '/assets/print-CPDMw9Kp.css' 
because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type
```

## Root Cause Identified
The `vercel.json` was **missing the critical `/assets/` route**:

### Before (BROKEN):
```json
"routes": [
  {
    "src": "/build/(.*)",
    "dest": "/build/$1"
  },
  {
    "src": "/(.*)",  // This catch-all was intercepting /assets/ requests!
    "dest": "/api"
  }
]
```

### What was happening:
1. Browser requests `/assets/entry.client-BkEv3vMM.js`
2. No specific route for `/assets/*` exists
3. Request falls through to catch-all `/(.*) ‚Üí /api`
4. API returns HTML (the React app)
5. Browser gets HTML instead of JS/CSS
6. MIME type error and 404

## The Fix
Added explicit `/assets/` route BEFORE the catch-all:

### After (FIXED):
```json
"routes": [
  {
    "src": "/assets/(.*)",  // ‚Üê THIS WAS MISSING!
    "dest": "/assets/$1"
  },
  {
    "src": "/build/(.*)",
    "dest": "/build/$1"
  },
  {
    "src": "/(.*)",
    "dest": "/api"
  }
]
```

## Why This Works
- Vite/Remix builds assets to `build/client/assets/`
- Vercel serves from `outputDirectory: "build/client"`
- Routes must explicitly map `/assets/*` requests to the asset files
- Order matters: specific routes must come before catch-all

## Deployment Status
- **Commit**: db08253
- **Branch**: main
- **Status**: Deploying to Vercel

## What This Fixes
‚úÖ All JavaScript files will load correctly
‚úÖ All CSS files will have proper MIME type
‚úÖ No more 404 errors for assets
‚úÖ Application will render properly
‚úÖ Create credit note button will work

## Verification
After deployment completes:
1. Check Network tab - all assets should return 200
2. No MIME type errors in console
3. Application loads without "Application Error"
4. CSS styles apply correctly
5. JavaScript functionality works

## Key Learning
**Route order in vercel.json is critical!** The catch-all route `/(.*) ‚Üí /api` must be LAST, after all specific asset routes. Otherwise, it intercepts asset requests and returns the wrong content.
