## Known Limitations

1. **Store Selection**: The app needs to be run with a development store. Use:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   And select a dev store when prompted.

2. **Advanced Features**: Some advanced features from the CreditNoteService (like full transaction history and audit logs) are simplified in the current implementation but the database schema supports them for future enhancement.

## Next Steps

To further enhance the app:

1. **Customer Integration**: Connect with Shopify's Customer API to auto-populate customer data
2. **Email Notifications**: Implement email sending for credit note creation/redemption
3. **Reporting**: Add analytics and reporting features
4. **Bulk Operations**: Add ability to create multiple credit notes at once
5. **Export Features**: Add CSV export for accounting purposes

## Testing

1. Create a new credit note from the main dashboard
2. Check that it appears in the list
3. Navigate to Settings and save configuration changes
4. Test credit note deletion
