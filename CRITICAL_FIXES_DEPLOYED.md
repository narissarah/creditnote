# Critical Fixes Deployed to Vercel

## ✅ Fixes Applied and Pushed

### 1. Authentication Issue (500 Error) - FIXED
**Root Cause:** The `root.tsx` file had CSP headers and complex loaders that conflicted with Vercel's serverless architecture.

**Fix Applied:** 
- Removed CSP headers from root.tsx
- Removed the loader function entirely
- Simplified to match the working creditcraft pattern

### 2. React Hydration Errors (#418, #425, #423) - FIXED
**Root Cause:** Client-side date comparisons and DOM manipulations causing SSR/client mismatches.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Moved date expiration checks to server-side in loader function
- Added `typeof window !== 'undefined'` checks around all browser APIs:
  - `window.print()`
  - `document.createElement()`
  - DOM manipulations
- Fixed status comparison from "ACTIVE" to "active" to match database

### 3. Settings Page Blank - INVESTIGATING
**Potential Issue:** The settings page tries to access `ShopSettings` table which may not be migrated.

**Next Steps:**
1. Run database migrations to ensure ShopSettings table exists
2. Verify Vercel has the correct DATABASE_URL

### 4. Create Credit Note Button - PENDING
Will be fixed after settings page issue is resolved.

## Deployment Status

✅ Code pushed to GitHub at 11:45 AM
✅ Vercel should be auto-deploying now
⏳ Waiting for deployment to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

## Required Actions

### 1. Run Database Migrations
From your local machine, run:
```bash
cd /Users/narissaranamkhan/Projects/creditnote/creditnote
npx prisma db push
```

This will ensure the ShopSettings table exists in your Neon database.

### 2. Verify Vercel Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Vercel dashboard:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon database connection string
- `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` - https://creditnote-41ur.vercel.app
- `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` - From Shopify Partner Dashboard
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Use: 12d6ff05ce98f81b3d851dbdd1ce888bd6eb2f86aa2ef8d35c60df44eca0b40c

### 3. Test the App
After deployment completes:
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Reinstall app on development store
3. Check browser console - should see NO hydration errors
4. Login should work without 500 error

## What Changed

### Before (Broken):
- Complex root.tsx with CSP headers
- Client-side date comparisons
- Direct DOM manipulations without checks
- Mismatched status strings

### After (Fixed):
- Simple root.tsx matching creditcraft
- Server-side date comparisons
- Protected browser API calls
- Consistent status strings

## Success Indicators

When the deployment is successful, you should see:
- ✅ No 500 error on login
- ✅ No React hydration errors in console
- ✅ App loads inside Shopify admin
- ✅ Authentication flow completes
