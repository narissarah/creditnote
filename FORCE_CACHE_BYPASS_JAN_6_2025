CRITICAL: FORCE CACHE BYPASS - JANUARY 6, 2025
TIMESTAMP: 2025-01-06T20:00:00Z
BUILD_ID: extreme-cache-bypass-jan-6-2025
STATUS: VERCEL CACHE LOCKOUT - NUCLEAR OPTION DEPLOYED

RESEARCH FINDINGS:
- Vercel CDN cache blocking all deployments
- JavaScript files stuck at index-BjHOyf6-.js
- VERCEL_FORCE_NO_BUILD_CACHE=1 implemented
- Aggressive build cache clearing enabled
- Timestamped asset names force cache miss

MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED:
1. User must go to Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to project settings
3. Click "Redeploy" button
4. OR run: vercel --force (if CLI linked)
5. OR purge cache manually in dashboard

This build will force completely new asset names and bypass all caching layers.
